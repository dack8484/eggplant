A lowpro board with the layout of an alpha.

Utilizing the same nonexistent mounting style of the Baby Grand, this double meme hybrid board is a nightmare. Choc switches only, alpha layout only, SMD diodes only, and also if you get this in a color other than purple you're committing a crime against God. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55664712/135018494-f182fa31-f13c-4135-bc55-1ef9feb91b5a.png)
haha picture has my foot haha

The second in my series of shameless alpha copies, I actually didn't ask for permission this time. This is payback for him procrastinating posting my alpha to his Instagram even though he promised like, months ago. I haven't written firmware yet because I can't be bothered.
The files are .zips because GitHub didn't let me upload the folder and if you can't unzip the folder maybe you don't deserve to get the board.
